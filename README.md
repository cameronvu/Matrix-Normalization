# Matrix Normalization
This project provides implementations of both matrix column normalization and an explicit list memory allocator in C. The column normalization module (colnorm_base.c and colnorm_opti.c) includes a baseline version and an optimized multithreaded version that efficiently normalizes columns to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1, improving performance for large matrices and high thread counts. The memory allocator module (el_malloc.c) implements a custom heap using an explicit free list, supporting allocation, deallocation, block splitting, and heap expansion with mmap(). Together, these components illustrate low-level memory management and performance optimization in C programming. This project can be adapted in several ways: the normalization module could be extended to handle sparse matrices, GPU acceleration, or row-wise normalization; the allocator could be enhanced with different allocation strategies, support for multiple heaps, or integration with memory debugging tools. Both modules provide a foundation for experimenting with parallelism, caching, and low-level system programming in a variety of applications.
